Log Analyisys

Objectives: 
-python introduction, work with libraries such as Pandas and matploitb
-log analysys, understand the network, what Data Science involves? How is it applied in CyberSec?

DATA SCIENCE 101
Basically it revolves around working with data, interpreting it to answer questions.
What kind of questions? Depends on the sector, is it e-commerce? is it automotive? is it cybersecurity?

A Data Scientist/Analyst will have different tasks:
-collecting the data - find and gather data, databases? recent sales? logs? 
-processing it - make it so that you can actually work on/with it
-mining data - extracting and connecting info
-data analysis - understand and make projections
-communication - this is the final objective to the process, give the answer

DS IN CYBERSEC
In cybersecurity the understanding of logs, and an effective use of data, can help understanding the network, how it works and possible threats.
SIEMs: gather data, logs for analysis
Threat Trends: understand what are the threats in the network and help preventing them
Predictive analisys: will help understand the future threats' landscape on the network, helping the prevention of these

Printing text
print("text")
#
Variables
a variable works with a label and data
this is how it works
label = data
eg.: name = "jimmy"
we set a variable
with 
print(name)
we will get
jimmy
#
Lists
lists can contain multiple values within as variables
employees ["Jimmy","Cain","Lucas"]
sooo
print(employees)
will list the employees list (thus the variables/the values we set)
>>>> ["Jimmy","Cain","Lucas"]
