This Rick and Morty-themed challenge requires you to exploit a web server and find three ingredients to help Rick make his potion and transform himself back into a human from a pickle.

Deploy the virtual machine on this task and explore the web application: 10.10.241.28
###
While performing an nmap scan of the target, I checked the Web site
and found soomething in the Source code

  nmap -A -v -T4 -sV 10.10.241.28
result in 11 seconds

Now I think I'll start some enum on the target web server
http://10.10.241.28/login.php
with gobuster
#
but i got the password in the /robots.txt 
Password: ****************
###
once gained access to the Web site we have access to the the Server, open to command execution
pwd
//tells us where we're located (www-data)
from there we can use 'ls' to navigate the file system
and we'll be able to get the first flag right away, following the directory http://IP/[file].txt
to get the second one let's navigate some more through the file system
using 'cat' doesn't work, it's blocked so we need to find another option: 'less' is helpful here (with ' at start and end of paths)
#
options may be over but we need to get a third flag, why not escalate?
sudo -l
//command to list permissions as root of current user
as root I can do everything, with no restricions
so I go to the /root
and find the third and last flag
